# Car-Detection
A few days ago, I completed my python training with my tutor and mentor, Davies Iyanuoluwa Ogunsina, who taught me how to use open-cv to detect objects.  Below you will see a program I ran to detect cars using haar-cascade detection in open-cv.OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers using the cv.CascadeClassifier.load method.
